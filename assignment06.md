## Project 6 - Laravel - Split table in two

**Brief:** Split your single table from the previous project into two tables. 

**Requirements:** Using the previous project code, refactor your project to work with two tables: `menuitems` and `catsubcats`. If you did the previous project with 3 tables you will need to merge them into two.

- As a team, work through the table schema to determine the best structure for your tables.
Your code will need to be modified to accommodate two tables
- Outline the logic of how your program will work using a shared Google drawing

**Recommendations:** Mak sure yer lagic is flowless BEFARE beganning any wark.
