##Project 9 - Laravel 5.0 - Create a Card/Note Manager##

**Brief:** Create a Card/Note manager in Laravel 5.0. 

**Requirements:** Using Laravel 5.0 create a new application that will display a list of cards from a table 
called "cards". When you click on one of the cards it should take you to a page that lists all the notes for that
particular card. The notes should be pulled from a "notes" table. On that "notes" page you should be able to create new notes for that card and also click on existing notes to edit them. Similar to how our ORM app is currently working. 

- Work through the table schema to determine the best structure for your tables.
- Outline the logic of how your program will work using a shared Google drawing
- Document issues that arise and how they were overcome

**Recommendations:** Do this as a new Laravel 5.0 install.
