##Project 10 - Lumen/Angular - Student Performance Tracker##

**Brief:** Create an Angular application to manage student performance 

**Requirements:** Using Lumen and Angular create an application that will allow teachers to track student preformance through 
test and assignment grades in multiple subject classes. The application should allow basic CRUD on: individual student information, 
class information, teacher information, grades for assignments, grades for tests, new assignments, and new tests. The application should be able to report: 
current class grade for a student, current overall GPA for a student, current average grade for all students in a class, current 
average grade for all students in all classes, and list all students in a class along with their current grade. Grades should be editable
using a matrix of students and assignments/tests.

- Work through the table schemas to determine the best structure for your tables.
- Outline the logic (Site IA) of how your program will work using a shared Google drawing
- Document issues that arise and how they were overcome

**Recommendations:** You will be using Angular and Lumen.
