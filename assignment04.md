## Project 4 - Laravel - Commenting

Brief: Explain your code, within your code.

Requirements: Using comment tags, describe the purpose of each section of your code. Please provide attribution where applicable (e.g. “Jordan made a script that automatically did everything”). 

Commit and push to your “laramenu” repository when you are done.

Recommendations: Walk through your code, from start to finish, commenting the views, layout, route, and controller files.

You may use either single line or block comments:

// this is a comment

/*
 *
 * this is a block comment
 *
 */
