##Project 11 - Heroku - Launch an App on Heroku##

**Brief:** Deploy a sample application on Heroko 

**Requirements:**  Using the tutorial at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#introduction follow 
along to clone and deploy the sample PHP application on Heroku. Once you have deployed the sample app continue following the 
instructions all the way through to configuring the Postgres database.

- Follow each step carefully, read through each step first to make sure nothing gets overlooked
- If there is something you do not understand or a term you are unfamiliar with, stop and Google it
- Do some science, make changes, mess it up

**Recommendations:** Tutorial should take you about 2-3 hours to get through. I expect everyone to do this individually, but work together.
